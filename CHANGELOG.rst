Flask-Injector Changelog
========================

Version 0.7.0 (not released yet)
--------------------------------

* Added support for injecting into Flask-RestPlus Resource constructors

Version 0.6.2
-------------

* Fixed a regression introduced in 0.6.1 (requesting an interface bound in
  RequestScope outside request context got broken and would raise
  "AttributeError: scope" exception. Even though it's not a documented
  behaviour it's restored now so that backwards compatibility is preserved.

Version 0.6.1
-------------

* Python 2.6 support dropped
* Fixed a memory leak bug (a reference to thread-identity object would be kept
  forever after a request would be served by particular thread; without greenlet
  package installed thread ids (numeric values) are used so the internal
  dictionary of thread local storage grows forever; when greenlet package is
  installed greenlet objects are used as thread identities by Werkzeug so on top
  of the internal storage growing infinitely all objects referenced by those
  greenlet objects are kept alive; keywords: Eventlet, Gevent, GreenThread). See
  GH issue #9 and pull request #11, thanks to Zi Li for the fix
